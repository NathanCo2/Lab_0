Run real or simulated dynamic response tests and plot the results. This program
demonstrates a way to make a simple GUI with a plot in it. It uses Tkinter, an
old-fashioned and ugly but useful GUI library which is included in Python by
default.

This file is based loosely on an example found at
https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/user_interfaces/embedding_in_tk_sgskip.html
