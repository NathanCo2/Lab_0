Program Description: 
The step_response.py program was created to run a single step response that output a list of voltage 
in relation to time as a comma separated values. This created program was also saved as the main.py program 
in the microcontroller on the Nucleo32. An additional program, lab0_pc_interface,py, invovling user interface 
was incorporated to output a response plot displaying an exponential curve of the step respose. The attached 
image depicts the created theoretical curve.
