Program Description: 
The step_response.py program was created to run a single-step response that outputs a list of voltage 
in relation to time as comma-separated values. This created program was also saved as the main.py program 
in the microcontroller on the Nucleo32. An additional program, lab0_pc_interface.py, involving a user interface 
was incorporated to output a response plot displaying an exponential curve of the step response. The first 
image displays the output obtained from the step response and the following depicts the created theoretical 
curve obtained from the user interface.
